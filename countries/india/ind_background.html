      <p> In the south of Asia, there is a country known as India, located between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea. It covers an area of over 3.287 million km², making it the 7th largest country in size, with a population of over 1,398,790,980 in 2021, making it the second most populated country in the world. The currency used in India is known as rupees and is represented by this symbol ( ₹ ). As of right now ( 2021 ), 1 Euro equals
      83.86 Indian Rupee. India is a very diverse country, with over 22 languages in each state. Most citizens in India can speak in 2 tongues, firstly in Hindi as that is the national language expressed throughout the country and secondly and secondly the language of the state they live in as every state has a different language. However, in more recent years, India has shown itself to be a more progressive country with many people learning that language of business which is English. 
      Here I have highlighted a few critical years in Indian history </p>

      <p>-3300BC - Indus river valley civilization</p>
      <p>The first-ever recorded existence of India was the Indus river valley civilization. It was one of the first civilizations created with a basic concept of society due to a river nearby called the Yamuna river. However, the culture soon had to end due to frequent floods.</p>
      
      <p>-2300BC - Hinduism founded</p>
      <p>During this period, new people entered India and while it is unsure as to who they are. We know they were responsible for creating verdict texts consisting of hymns and mantras, which now is the basis of the most prominent religion in India that is believed by nearly 79.8%, known as Hinduism. </p>
      
      <p>-483BC - Buddhism </p>
      <p>Siddhartha Gautama, a prince, believed in wealth to seek enlightenment as a spiritual ascetic. Due to his beliefs, he renounced his position as prince and instead taught wisdom, kindness, patience, generosity, and compassion were essential virtues to the people of his country, which are now known as the basis of Buddhism. Further, Siddhartha Gautama is now better known as the Buddha. Even though only 5.81% of the population consider themselves Buddist, it is still a well-known religion all across India.</p>
      
      <p>-324BC- Maurya empire</p>
      <p>Candragupta Maurya ran the Maurya empire; it was the first emperor to capture most of India, excluding Tamil Nadu, which the Tamil kings governed; many people suspect they were seemingly merchants. However, the Maurya empire soon fell after 136 years. The death of Asoka first caused the decline and then finally came to an end. When Brihadratha Maurya went to a military parade, unfortunately, his general killed him then, and because he had no heir to continue, the Maurya kingdom came to its fall.</p>
      
      <p>-4BC - golden age of India</p>
      <p>During the Gupta empire, India made considerable accomplishments as it made extensive inventions and discoveries in mathematics, astronomy, science, religion and philosophy. During 550BC, the Huna People attacked India while it was under the region of the Gupta empire and caused significant damage to the empire.</p>
      
      <p>-1206 - Delhi Sultanate Empire</p>
      <p>Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate Empire, had ruled over the Indian subcontinent for over 300 years. The end of the Delhi Sultanate was due to the death of Ibrahim Lodi. </p>
      
      
      <p>-1526 - Mughal empire</p>
      <p>Babur founded the Mughal empire; however sadly died four years in, but that didn't stop the kingdom; it continued to prosper and is the first empire to bring all of India under one rule. Another notable achievement by the Mughal empire was the construction of the taj mahal. </p>
      
      
      <p>-1858 - Britain conquered</p>
      <p>The East India company came into the country, taking advantage of the fact that the government was not united and could easily conquer them. From the 1600s until 1858, it was under the rule of the East India company. In 1858, India had a revolution known as the Indian rebellion of 1858. They wanted to govern themselves now; therefore, to get rid of Britain's domain, they revolted against the East India company. Britain did not like that; thus, after overcoming their revolt, they started to govern them even harder by changing their name to British raj. </p>
      
      <p>After the revolt from India, the east Indian company lost all of its administrative powers after the government of India passed the act of 1859. This caused all Indian possessions and the army to be taken over by the crown. Due to this, it allowed Britain to rule over India directly through the British raj.</p>
      
      
      <p>-1947- Mahatma Gandhi</p>
      
      <p>Born in Porbandar, India, Mahatma Gandhi was the leader behind the Indian's non-violent movement towards independence against British rule. </p>
