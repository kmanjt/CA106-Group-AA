    <p>India is a very religious place with over 79.8% of people considering themselves to be Hindus. Thus most of its beliefs are rooted from it’s religion
      One of the most popular Indian greetings is Namaste, sometimes called namaskar or namaskaram, translating as 'I bow to the divine in you. This respectful way of saying hello, goodbye, and thank you has seen an e around the massive world uptake during the Coronavirus outbreak as an alternative to handshakes and hugs. The gesture is performed by placing the palms together in a prayer pose in front of the chest, fingers pointing upwards, and making a slight bow.
      Another famous saying is 'Atithi Devo Bhava', a Sanskrit verse from Hindu scriptures that translates as 'the guest is equivalent to god'. In Indian culture, guests have always been given supreme importance.
      You might also encounter the Indian head shake, which can mean yes, thank you or indicate understanding, depending on the context of the conversation.</p>
    
      
      <p>India is a land where people from different religions coexist harmoniously. 79.8% of the population worship Hinduism, 14.2% Islam, 2.3% Christianity, 1.7% Sikhism, 0.7% Buddhism and 0.4% Jainism.
      The cow is a sacred animal in Hindu culture and is depicted in mythology as accompanying several gods such as Shiva on his bull Nandi or Krishna, the cowherd god. The horns represent the gods, the four legs are 'Vedas' (ancient Hindu scriptures), and the udder is the four objectives of life – desire, material wealth, righteousness and salvation. Consuming beef or killing a cow is considered sinful, and it is illegal to slaughter a cow in several states.
      Fasts ('Vrats' or 'Upvas') are a vital part of Indian culture to give thanks to Gods and Goddesses and show resolve and sincerity. It is thought that by going without the necessity of food, you will cleanse yourself of sin. Fasts are observed through India on various days and a range of religious occasions.</p>

    <p>A joint family in India is where the entire family all live together, including parents, wife, children and occasionally relatives. At the head of the family is a 'Karta', a senior male or female who makes economic and social decisions on behalf of the entire family. Other relations can be equal, of mutual respect or teasing in nature. Income goes into a shared pool, which benefits all members. Nowadays, economic development and urbanisation have led to an increase in nuclear-like families than joint families.
      Arranged marriage is still a strong tradition in India. This dates back to Vedic times in 1500–1100 BCE where suitable matches from around the kingdom would compete in competitions to win the hand of a royal bride.</p>

      <p>Exploring Indian temples is a magical experience, but a few things to remember before you visit. Many of these sacred buildings were deliberately built at places rich in positive energy from the magnetic wave lines of the Earth. Most temples feature one main idol, a copper plate called the Garbhagriha or Moolasthan underneath that absorbs and resonates this underground energy. Therefore, it's good practice to have a bath or shower before entering a temple or at least washing your hands and feet to cleanse yourself of negative thoughts and evil influences.
      Appropriate attire is essential, namely conservative clothing to indicate respect. Women should ideally wear a modest top and a calf or ankle-length skirt or trousers that will allow sitting comfortably cross-legged on the floor. Men should wear trousers and a shirt. Avoid wearing leather or animal skin of any kind, as this is offensive to practising Hindus.
      You will also need to remove your footwear before entering places of worship to prevent any dirt from coming into a cleansed and sanctified environment. A top tip is to choose shoes that are easy to remove. If you'd prefer to keep your socks on, that's fine; make sure they are clean and free from holes!</p>
