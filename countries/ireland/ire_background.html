	   	   	</div>
	   	   	<p>
	   	   		Ireland was under the rule of the United Kingdom(U.K) starting as far back as the 12th century. In the 19th century groups around Ireland formed and opposed British rule. There was hope for a rebellion to begin in Dublin and spread throughout Ireland but never got further than Dublin. This was on April 24th in 1916 where the Irish tried to rebel against the British but only lasted for 6 days. This led to fights between the Irish and British soldiers where the Irish held the General Post Office in Dublin(GPO) for six days until they were defeated. The GPO was a headquarters for the uprising's leaders for the short period it went on and was destroyed by gunfire. Now there only remains the bullet holes in the pillars outside the building to show people what it may have been like. Inside a museum in the GPO was the Proclamation of the Irish Republic until the museum closed in May 2015. After the Irish surrendered 15 leaders of the rising were executed by firing squad, 3000 suspected of supporting the rising were arrested and imprisoned without trial.

              <h4> The Famine </h4>
	   	   	<p>
	   	   		In 1845 Ireland was heavily reliant on the potato crop as a source of nutrition and was their main crop. The population was 8.5 million and growing. The Famine was caused due to the potato crop being targeted by a disease which turned the potatoes a black looking colour and made the potatoes inedible. Many people were unsure what to do and tried to grow more of the crop but with it taking about 3 months for the potatoes to grow many were going to starve. Those who cattle or cows tried to hold it out hoping the disease would go away. Some fled early and went to America, Canada or Australia and started again with nothing. Those that tried to hold it out eventually tried to flee but with the ship taking 5-7 weeks to reach America many died on the ships with them being nicknamed 'coffin ships'. The Famine ended around 1852 and Irelands population is said to have dropped around 25% with many having emigrated and close to a million having died.

              <h4> St.Patricks Parade </h4>
	   	   	<p>
	   	   		The 17th of March is St. Patricks day is a celebration of the arrival of Christianity to Ireland and the death date of St.Patrick who brought Christianity to Ireland. Known in Ireland as 'Paddys day' the day is also to celebrate Irish culture and heritage and usually, people will dress up in a green costume or wear green out and go to a parade that would be held near them. The parade would usually be a chance for people to show their talent or something a group had achieved. There would be musical bands all throughout the parade and people part of the parade would throw out items of sweets usually. The main part of the parade would be a big st. Patrick figures usually at the end of the parade. The day traditionally was a religious holiday where people would celebrate their Christianity and pubs would close but nowadays its an excuse for people to go out drinking at the pubs. Dublin where the main parade is held and can be viewed on TV is where almost 500,000 people cram into every year and there are events for all the family to enjoy.
