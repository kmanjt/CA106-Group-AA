	   				<ol>
	   					<li>Although more associated with Scotland kilts were worn by many Irish men since around the 1850s. They were worn as a symbol of pride and to celebrate their Celtic heritage.</li>
	   					
                        <li>Flat caps became associated with Ireland when back in 1571 a law was passed that said On Sundays and holidays all males over the age of 6 must wear one except for the 'nobility' or they would have to pay a fine of 3/4 penny a day. It was so the use of wool would stay up. Then in 1597, the law was retracted but people had become so used to them that they kept using them and have stuck around since. They have since been seen with all types of clothing from going on with farm clothing to going with your suit.</li>
                        
                        <li>Brogue shoes were first used in Ireland and Scotland around the 16th century and were first used as shoes while working as the holes on the top of the shoe allowed water to drain from them more quickly. The name brogue comes from the Irish 'bróg' meaning leg covering.</li>

            <h4>Dance Clothing</h4>
            	<p>
            	Female dancers and Male dancers wear different clothing to each other in Irish dancing. Females would usually wear a hooded cloak over a white dress. Their outfit would traditionally be green and white and be embroidered with Celtics designs. Females would wear a type of shoe called a ghillie shoe and they would not make noise against the floor as they danced.

            	Male dancers outfits would match the same colour as their Female dance partner and they would typically wear a shirt and trousers. The male dancer would wear a type of shoe called a reel shoe and it would click together while dancing or tap on the floor and that is what can be heard while they are dancing.

            	Both Male and females could wear hard shoes which dancers called 'Heavies' and were much bulkier and would have fibreglass tips to make a louder sound while dancing. Shoes could cost anywhere between €90 to €180 and would require breaking in which helps loosen the leather. There are many types of Irish dancing which is the reason for the different types of shoes, to match the type of dance to perform. There are 6 types of Irish dance:
                <ul>
                	<li>Traditional Irish step dancing</li>
                	<li>Modern Irish step dancing</li>
                	<li>Irish set dancing</li>
                	<li>Irish ceili dancing</li>
                	<li>Irish sean nos dancing</li>
                	<li>Irish two hands dancing</li>
                </ul>

                Some types of dance require only a slight difference in outfits but for the most part, the traditional clothing covers all the categories of dance. The shoes would be the only thing to be an obvious change where more clicks may be heard or less with each dance category.

             	<h4>Irish dancing</h4>
             	<p>
             		Irish dance is believed to have begun around the 17th-18th century and is believed to have been influenced by English and French styles of dance. The music used in Irish dance is made mostly by traditional Irish instruments such as the tin whistle and the Bodhran(drum). The whole dance involves the dancers outfits, shoes and music to make up the whole dance. The main focus is on the shoes as Irish dance is focused on rhythm and foot placement. There are two ways a dancer uses their feet while dancing they are ballet up and flat down. Ballet up is when a dancer is on the balls of their feet or on their toes and flat down is the heel laying flat and body weight sinks downwards. The most famous type of Irish dance is Irish step dancing which involves traditional and modern versions. Irelands most famous dance performance would be in the 1994 Eurovision song contest when during the interval Micheal Flatley took the stage by storm. The scene began with choir vocals then entered Jean Butler followed closely by Micheal Flatley who with his fast feet battled the 4 drummers beats. It was a completely new look, style and dance compared to previous Irish dance. The dance continued with more dancers following Micheal and Jeans feet and were all perfectly synchronised. Nowadays the Riverdance group have travelled the world showing the world their mesmerising dance. Video below is of Irish riverdance at the Eurovision.
